### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ben Mickle and I want to show the world that furries are not zoophiles and autism does not make someone r-word with my software.  I am one of the few Linux users in the Nintendo m#%^ing scene.  I had to censor it because of the goddamn Japanese zoophiles known as Nintendo Ninjas.  Expect to see cross-platform modding tools from me (maybe even with some Linux exclusive easter eggs)
